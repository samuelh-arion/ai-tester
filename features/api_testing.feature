Feature: Browser-Based API Testing Platform
  As a QA engineer or developer
  I want to generate and manage API tests through a web interface
  So that I can ensure my API endpoints work correctly without writing code manually

  Background:
    Given I am on the API testing web application
    And I have an OpenAPI specification file (openapi.json) ready to upload

  Scenario: Generate Gherkin features from OpenAPI specification
    When I upload the OpenAPI specification file through the web interface
    Then the system should analyze the OpenAPI specification
    And automatically generate Gherkin feature files based on the API endpoints
    And display the generated feature files in the web editor
    And allow me to download the generated feature files

  Scenario: Customize generated Gherkin features
    Given I have generated Gherkin features from my OpenAPI specification
    When I use the web editor to modify a feature file
    Then my changes should be saved in real-time
    And the modified feature content should be preserved
    And I should be able to add custom test scenarios and steps

  Scenario: Generate and execute Cucumber.js tests
    Given I have finalized my Gherkin feature files
    When I click the "Generate Tests" button
    Then the system should generate Cucumber.js test files based on:
      | The OpenAPI specification |
      | The Gherkin features     |
    And when I click "Run Tests"
    Then the Cucumber.js tests should be executed against my API
    And I should see the test results in the web interface
    And a detailed test report should be generated

  Scenario: Manage complete test suite files
    Given I am working on an API testing project
    When I click the "Download Test Suite" button
    Then I should receive a zip file containing:
      | OpenAPI specification file |
      | Gherkin feature files     |
      | Generated Cucumber.js tests|
      | Test configuration files   |
    
    When I have a previously exported test suite
    And I click the "Upload Test Suite" button
    And I select a valid test suite zip file
    Then the system should:
      | Import the OpenAPI specification    |
      | Load all Gherkin feature files     |
      | Restore the Cucumber.js test files |
      | Apply the test configurations      |
    And I should see all imported files in the web interface
    And I should be able to continue editing and running tests

  Scenario: Configure API environments
    Given I am setting up my test environment
    When I click on "Manage Environments"
    Then I should be able to add multiple environments:
      | Development |
      | Staging     |
      | Production  |
    And for each environment I can configure:
      | Base URL          |
      | Authentication    |
      | Custom Headers    |
      | Request Timeouts  |
    And I can switch between environments when running tests

  Scenario: Manage test data
    Given I am preparing test data for my API tests
    When I click on "Test Data Manager"
    Then I should be able to:
      | Create test data sets           |
      | Import test data from CSV/JSON  |
      | Link data sets to test cases    |
      | Use variables in test scenarios |
    And the test data should be available during test execution

  Scenario: Handle API authentication
    Given I need to test authenticated endpoints
    When I configure authentication settings
    Then I should be able to set up:
      | API Keys           |
      | OAuth 2.0         |
      | Bearer Tokens     |
      | Basic Auth        |
    And store credentials securely
    And use different credentials per environment

  Scenario: Validate and handle errors
    Given I am working with the testing platform
    When I perform invalid operations, the system should handle:
      | Invalid OpenAPI specification format |
      | Malformed feature files             |
      | Missing required test data          |
      | Invalid environment configurations   |
    Then I should see clear error messages
    And suggestions for resolving the issues
    And my existing work should not be lost
    
  Scenario: View test analytics and reports
    Given I have executed test suites
    When I navigate to the "Test Reports" section
    Then I should see:
      | Test execution history      |
      | Success/failure rates       |
      | Response time statistics    |
      | API endpoint coverage       |
    And I should be able to:
      | Export reports in multiple formats |
      | Share reports with team members   |
      | Set up automated report delivery  |
